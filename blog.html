    <p>Sometimes the things I most want to teach do not fit into our regular curriculum: lessons about life, love, and joy.</p>
    <p>When I have a thing or two to say about these important subjects, I will put them here for you to enjoy :)</p>

      <h3>It Sucks to be a Book</h3>
      <p class="date">April 3rd, 2017</p>
      <p>You know what really sucks? There are so many books in the world, no one can read all of them. That sucks for people. It sucks for books, too.
          Even the most successful book will only be read by a fraction of the literate population of the Earth. Unless it's the Bible. Or Harry Potter.
          For the rest of them, they are up a creek.</p>

      <h3>Poems</h3>
      <p class="date">December 9th, 2016</p>
      <p>People are always trying</p>
      <p>To put meaning</p>
      <p>On poems</p>
      <p>Or to put them</p>
      <p>In a meter.</p>
      <p>Can't we just</p>
      <p>Let them be?</p>
